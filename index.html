        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>Gothenburg was first made into a city in 1621 by the then Swedish King Gustaf II Adolf. While the city is located in Sweden, the city has had a lot of influence from neighboring European countries around it, such as Germany, Scotland, and the Netherlands. Because of this, the city
            bears some resemblence to western european cities such as amsterdam. Fishing used to be the main industry of the city, which has now switched more to manufacturing and trade. It was also were the Swedish East India Company was located, which had also made the city rich from its trade with the far east.

        <h2>Geography</h2>
        <p>The city is known for having mild temperatures despite the fact that the city is so far north. It is considered to be an temperate oceanic climate and can be very windy during the winter, along with the cold temperatures. During the summer the sun will be out for a total of 18 hours a day and during the winter the sun will only be out for six and a half hours.
            The location of Gothenburg is about half of the way between Oslo and Copenhagen, Norway's capital and Denmark's capital respectively. The area around Gothenburg, in particular for the islands right next to Gothenburg, is defined by rocky land and cliffs, with less vegetation than you would find in Gothenburgs mainland.
            Gothenburg is quite hilly, with many small lakes that surround the area. The city has many rivers that flow through it, but the most important one is the Göta Canal, which was made to stretch all the way to Stockholm to allow goods to travel through Sweden easier. It is also the capital of Västra Götaland, one of Sweden's most populous counties.</p>
