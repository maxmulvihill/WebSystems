        <p>If you are only looking to stay for a little bit (for a vacation), Gothenburg has plenty of hotels in the area ranging from cheap hostels to expensive and luxirious hotels. You can start looking at <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Hotels-g189894-Gothenburg_Vastra_Gotaland_County_West_Coast-Hotels.html" target="_blank" >TripAdvisor for more information</a>.</p>
        <p>The prices obviously vary based on location, floor space, and quality. The inner city of gothenburg tends to mostly have flats with some houses around. One of the best parts of living in Gothenburg is the walkability of the city. If you live close to the city center, you 
            will be treated to have many shops close by where you can get a coffee, for instance. The city has a very good public transportation system and many of the streets are made to make public transporation a priority.</p>

         <p>Outside of the city center you are closer to many wonderful parks and swimming spots. Owning a bicycle in Gothenburg is great as you will be able to easily ride on trails that are close to your abode. Even if you don't own one, there is a bike sharing program in Gothenburg that allows people to rent bikes for a little bit. Many cycling paths line the surrounding area that are safe for families and novice cyclists to ride on.</p>
