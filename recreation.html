        <h2>Nature and Parks</h2>
        <p>Gothenburg is filled to the brim with local parks and nature reserves inside and outside of the city. Slottskogen (literally <em>The castle's forest</em>) is very close to the city center and has many trails that you can ride a bike or walk on. There is a lot of open space for people to have picnics or for field sports to be played. There is also a zoo inside of the park that features local Nordic animals and has free admission. 
        There is also Delsjöområdets nature reserve just east of the city, which features many swimming areas, beautiful forest areas and trails that you can hike on. It is such a popular place to go to on the weekends that a common complaint of the nature reserve is that there can be too many people there sometimes. 
        Another good park to visit is Keillers park, located close to the Göta Canal. The main attraction of this park is the great view of the city and the harbor that you are able to get from the top of the hill. Like the other parks, there are plenty of open spaces for picnics and many trails that you can take. </p>

        <h2>Cultural Places</h2>
        <p>Gothenburg is home to many museums and libraries that you are able to visit. One of these museums is the Volvo museum, located right next to one of Gothenburg's busiest ports. It is a very popular museum with old cars that can date back all the way to the company's founding in 1924. Cruise ships often dock into the port next
            to the museum, which makes up a good chunk of visitors. If art is more of your thing, Gothenburg's konsthall (<em>art hall</em>) has many exhibits that change seasonally. The exhibits can range from paintings to sculptures to experiences with a VR headset. If you would like to find out more about the art hall, <a href="https://goteborgskonsthall.se/en/exhibitions/" target="_blank">please visit here</a>.
